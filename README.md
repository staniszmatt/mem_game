# Memory Match - Version 0.1 (v0.1)

#### Overview

> This version is used to reinforce HTML, CSS & layout concepts to put your own flare into a classic game of 
concentration. The scope for this version asks the student to choose a theme for the game including: 

> - 9 card faces
> - 1 card back
> - Creating an about page describing about the game and the skills that went into creating it.

> This version will integrate with instructor built JavaScript to give the layout built by the student's functionality 
and show the ability of design & layout to be independent of functionality but strict requirements are needed 
(specific classes and id’s). In future versions the students will be building out the same functionality that is 
provided with each student providing their own flare and features. The students will pull the knowledge from what 
they have learned from the resources they have consumed and the prototypes they have completed and pull it into one 
cohesive version of this project.
