                    I based this game based off Shopkins because this is what my daughter, Izabella, likes. 
                    Shopkins is an animated series and sell little grocery item toys that have animated human features.<br><br>
                    They toys are about the size of a marble and Izabella has over 200 different types of the Shopkins toys. 
                    She still plays with to this day! Kids also like trading their Shopkins like trading cards. 
                    Of course there are the super duper, ultra rare, Shopkin toys too to make things even more desirable to kids.<br><br>
                    
                    This game was an awesome challenge in trying to think of ways to logically setup, compare and loop through the game setup and play.   
                    I tried to pseudo code as much as I could but found that I missed a lot of setup.  
                    The best way I handled this was setting up the display features first, then added and tested each required functionality at a time until it was all complete. 
                    Some of the bugs that came up I would never of thought of until I ran through the game.  
                    For instance, clicking on a card that was already matched needed to be ignored otherwise wouldnâ€™t flip the cards back over correctly.<br><br> 
                    
                    There is so much more features, animation and sounds I would love to add but will need to save that for a later day.<br><br>
